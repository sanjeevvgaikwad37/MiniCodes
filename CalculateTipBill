/** You are in a job where you earn a tip for service.
 * You need a program that will calculate how much to add to the bill after calculating gratuity.
 * Your program will read the subtotal and the gratuity rate from the user, computes the gratuity and total and displays the results to the user.
 * For example, if the user enters 10 for subtotal and 15 for gratuity rate, the program displays $1.5 for gratuity and $11.5 as total.
 * Don’t worry that the format of the output is “$X.X” rather than “$X.XX”.
 * To calculate a tip, calculate subtotal * rate / 100 To calculate the total bill, use the above calculation and add to the subtotal. Sample run: Enter the subtotal or the bill 10 Enter the gratuity rate 15 The amount for gratuity is $1.5 The total final bill is $11.5
