/**4. (Area and perimeter of a rectangle)
 *  Write a program that prompts and reads user input for the width and height of a rectangle.
 *  You program will calculate and display the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
 *  The values for width and height should be treated a a number with a decimal point.
 *  Area and perimeter are calculated as shown below.
 *  area = width Ã— height perimeter = (2 x width) + (2 x height)
 *  The output from running the program with a width of 5.5 and height of 2.2 will be:
 *  Please enter the width: 5.5 Please enter the height: 2.2
 (you will likely have more to the right of the decimal point, and that is ok.)
 Area is 12.100000
 Perimeter is 15.4
